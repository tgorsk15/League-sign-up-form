<!--Structure of page

    Have photo and form section as two separate containers
        - want there to be 0 gap in between them, use flex for this?
    
    Logo strip:
        - have this stretch the span of the photo
        - this way I can more easily center the text and logo

    Form section:
        Top section:
        - provide a container with a welcome, overview message

        Middle section:
        - include last NBA team played for
        - first name
        - last name
        - email
        - phone number (try to create automatic dash format)
        - what team do you want to play for?
          (include a dropdown of all the team selections)

        Bottom section:
        - submit button
        -include an image that stretches span of container or
        some kind of gif that moves from edge to edge
