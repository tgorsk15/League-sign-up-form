# League-sign-up-form

This is a project I worked on to practice some of the more intermediate-level tools and intricacies of CSS and HTML. The form is a paradoy of a sign-up form for ex or retired NBA players who are wanting to join Ice Cube's basketball league, Big3.
Here are some of the biggest takeaways and skills I developed during this project:

- the ability to import fonts in VS Code, utilizing google fonts

- the abiity to use the <form> element to create user forms and prompt users different types of questions and information

- practiced utilizing psuedo-elements and classes to take my CSS to the next level (:required, :invalid, :valid, etc..)  also played around with ::before and ::after

- learned how to deal with <img> and background image, and how to adjust their margins, fill spaces, and dimensions

- got great practice, with box-shadow, text-shadow, display: flex, linear-gradient, and margin/padding adjusting
